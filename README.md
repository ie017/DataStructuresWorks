# Data Structures Works
A data structure is a particular way storing and organizing data in a computer for efficient access and modification. Data structures are designed for a specific purpose. Examples include arrays, linked lists, and classes.
topics : 
  B tree
  binary tree 
  Graph
  Hash table
  Matrix Chain Multiplication Dynamic Programming
  peaks in matrix
# Completion Requirements
Module 1: Propose an algorithm of searching for a key in a tree B of order n.
Module 2: We give a text, the text is a sequence of sentences and a sentence is a sequence of words separated by (,.:;-)
The words are possibly repeated and we want to display each word of the text with its frequency.
### `Use binary tree`
Question: how to display the words in alphabetical order?
Module3: Implement in C:
• The DFS recursive path.
• The BFS recursive path.
Here, the treatment of vertices is the display.
Hint: if possible, display a menu with operations.
Example :
hand(){
create a graph
display menu()
}
menu:
1- add a vertex.
2- add a bow.

3-delete a vertex.
4-remove an arc.
5-course in depth.
6-course in width.
7-leave.
A choice :
- the graph G can be directed or not.
- G can be represented either by an adjacent list or by a matrix
adjacent.
Module 4: We give a text, the text is a sequence of sentences and a sentence is a sequence of words separated by (,.:;-)
The words are possibly repeated and we want to display each word of the text with its frequency.
Question: how to display the words in alphabetical order?
### `Use hash table`
N.B: the 4th task is just to answer the question asked.
Module 5: Using dynamic programming.
Implement the chained product of n matrices and display the solution (with its parenthesis) and its cost.
Module 6: 1- Look for a peak in a matrix and apply the "divide and conquer" practice.
2- Search all the peaks (either with the 1st question or with another method.)
