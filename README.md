# Data Structures Works\
A data structure is a particular way storing and organizing data in a computer for efficient access and modification. Data structures are designed for a specific purpose. Examples include arrays, linked lists, and classes.\

# Completion Requirements\
Module 1: Propose an algorithm of searching for a key in a tree B of order n.\
Module 2: We give a text, the text is a sequence of sentences and a sentence is a sequence of words separated by (,.:;-)\
The words are possibly repeated and we want to display each word of the text with its frequency.\
### `Use binary tree`\
Question: how to display the words in alphabetical order?\
Module3: Implement in C:\
• The DFS recursive path.\
• The BFS recursive path.\
Here, the treatment of vertices is the display.\
Hint: if possible, display a menu with operations.\
Example :\
hand(){\
create a graph\
display menu()\
}\
menu:\
1- add a vertex.\
2- add a bow.\
3-delete a vertex.\
4-remove an arc.\
5-course in depth.\
6-course in width.\
7-leave.\
A choice :\
- the graph G can be directed or not.\
- G can be represented either by an adjacent list or by a matrix adjacent.\
Module 4: We give a text, the text is a sequence of sentences and a sentence is a sequence of words separated by (,.:;-)\
The words are possibly repeated and we want to display each word of the text with its frequency.\
Question: how to display the words in alphabetical order?\
### `Use hash table`\
N.B: the 4th task is just to answer the question asked.\
Module 5: Using dynamic programming.\
Implement the chained product of n matrices and display the solution (with its parenthesis) and its cost.\
Module 6: 1- Look for a peak in a matrix and apply the "divide and conquer" practice.\
2- Search all the peaks (either with the 1st question or with another method.)\
